## Clustering samples according to taxonomy

Another way to visualize similarity between plots is via a [cluster analysis](https://www.statmethods.net/advstats/cluster.html), which basically groups sites together according to their taxonomic composition. One way to do this is with Ward's Hierarchical Clustering method, which we implement below. Sites with more similar taxonomic composition will cluster together in this analysis. Please note that this figure does not change according the selected variable.
